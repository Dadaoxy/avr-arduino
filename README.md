===========

Everything needed to program a reaDIYmate board from the Arduino IDE.

You can find the file boards.txt and the directories (core and variant) in the hardware/ sub-directory of the Arduino application directory (for MacOSX developer, it's in the package under Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/arduino)

* For the boards.txt:  copy the readiymate part to your existing boards.txt file
* For the two directories, copy the readiymate directory to your existing core and variant directories.
